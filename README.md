# OneMinuteTrainer

OneMinuteTrainer is a web-based interval training timer that provides both visual and auditory cues to guide users through their training sessions. It features a simple yet powerful interface that flashes the screen at specific intervals and plays distinct sounds to denote different phases of the training minute.

## Features

- **Visual Feedback**: The background color changes to green at the start of each minute and to red during the last 10 seconds of each minute, aiding in visual timing.
- **Auditory Cues**: Different sounds are played at the beginning of each minute and during the last 10 seconds to help users keep track of time without constantly watching the clock.
